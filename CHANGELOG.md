# Changelog

All notable changes to Ma-est-tro are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `docs/MIDI_EDITOR.md` — technical documentation for the MIDI editor modal
  (architecture, module map, public API, state model, load/save data flow,
  MIDI value validation, keyboard shortcuts, event bus contract, extension
  points, logging convention, known limitations).
- Expanded README "MIDI Editor" section with feature table, CC list,
  keyboard shortcuts, and preferences reference.
- Cross-links from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/TABLATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
  to the new editor documentation.
- `tests/frontend/midi-editor-clamp.test.js` — 10 Vitest cases that pin the
  save-time MIDI clamping contract (note/channel/velocity/CC/pitch-bend
  ranges, tempo-map emission, drum-channel programChange skip).
- `common.on` / `common.off` translation keys across the 28 locale files, so
  the touch-mode / keyboard-playback / drag-playback toggle labels can be
  localised.

### Changed
- Migration 040 drops the unused `adaptation_metadata` column on `midi_files`
  (the JSON it carried was never read; the per-channel transposition data it
  duplicated is already stored on `midi_instrument_routings`).
- MIDI editor toggle labels (Touch mode, Keyboard playback, Drag playback)
  now go through `this.t('common.on') / this.t('common.off')` instead of the
  hard-coded English literals `'ON'` / `'OFF'`.
- File headers and inline comments across the MIDI editor modules
  (`public/js/views/components/MidiEditorModal.js` and the 19 files in
  `public/js/views/components/midi-editor/`) were translated from French to
  English, including JSDoc blocks, section separators, and HTML comments in
  template literals. About 300 comment lines touched; no executable code
  altered.

### Fixed
- Clamp out-of-range MIDI values in `convertSequenceToMidi` (note 0–127,
  channel 0–15, velocity 1–127, CC 0–127, pitch bend −8192…8191) so a corrupt
  in-memory sequence can no longer silently produce an invalid `.mid`.
- `file_routing_sync` now skips routings targeting channels absent from
  `midi_file_channels`, preventing orphan routings after a file edit that
  removed a channel.
- Deterministic tempo event ids (`tempo_<ticks>_<index>`) replace the previous
  `Date.now() + Math.random()` scheme so external references survive a reload.

### Removed
- Dead `MidiEditorState.js` (441 l.) and `MidiEditorFileOps.js` (798 l.)
  classes (loaded but never instantiated; their methods had been
  re-implemented as mixins).
- Orphan `copySequence` on `MidiEditorModal`, unused
  `_autoActivateTablature` stub, and redundant `localStorage` preference
  helpers (folded into `_getPreference` / `_setPreference`).
- File operations (`saveMidiFile`, `saveAsFile`, `showSaveAsDialog`,
  `showRenameDialog`, `convertSequenceToMidi`, …) moved out of
  `MidiEditorCCPicker.js` into a dedicated `MidiEditorFileOpsMixin.js`.
- `MidiTransposer.generateAdaptationMetadata()` (unused after migration 040).
